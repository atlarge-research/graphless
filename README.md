# Graphless

Graphless is a graph processing system based on the serverless paradigm, which proposes to simplify computing by letting developers only focus on small, stateless functions, which are deployed and managed automatically. 

This repository contains:
* A prototype push-based implementation in AWS Cloud: A1
* A prototype pull-based implementation in AWS Cloud: A2
* A set of experiments ran with the Graphalytics benchmarking tool
